The equivalence hypothesis the authours estabilish is that by combining any two of the estabilished body-mass scaling relationships they can arrive at equivalence relationships, which can then be tested against assumptions/predictions of metabolic theory across eukaryotes. The derived equivalence relationships are proposed to be invariant with body-mass which is specifically what the authours test.

The authours concerned themselves with population metabolism, lifetime growth, growth efficency, and lifetime metabolism which they tested with the null hypothesis of k ~= 0. In doing so, they found that only population metabolism and lifetime growth appeared to be invariant. The variance in growth efficency and lifetime metabolism suggests that metabolism does not play a determining role in controlling growth or lifespan, despite the consistency of in-group scaling to the 3/4 rule.
