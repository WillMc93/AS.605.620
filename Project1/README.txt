project1.py located in the root of the folder is the driver for this program (a copy can also be found in ./code). 
It was written under Xubuntu 19.04 and interpreted using Python 3.7.3

In *nix systems with Python 3 installed, it can be executed from this directory via the console command:

	python3 project1.py [path to input] [path to output]


For Windows, I'd highly recommend opening the project file from IDLE and
	using the Run Customized command (Shift + F5) to enter the paths.

NOTE: It does expect the output directory to exist. 
	I didn't want to go poking around in the file system for this project.



Additionally, I've included two bash scripts (run_all.sh and run_valid.sh) to run all the inputs and 
	all the valid (that is not purposely misformatted) inputs.
